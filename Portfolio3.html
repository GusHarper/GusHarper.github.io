        <h3>UK and US Interest Rates</h3>
        <p>This chart embeds data on UK and US Central Bank interest rates over time, and was constructed by converting CSV
            formated data into a dictionaries format. I modified this chart into a line chart, as it is much more appropraite  
            for comparing interest rates between the two countries. Stacking the data would be unncessesary, and serves no 
            visual purpose.
