        <h1>Is the U.K Spending Enough on Education? </h1>


<!-- Aims -->
        <h3>Aims</h3>

        <p>Education is a powerful agent of change, providing individuals with the skill-set and adaptability to 
        improve their standard of living while contributing to social stability and long-term economic growth. 
        This project aims to provide a background on educational spending in the UK, compare its investment with that
        of other nations, and assess whether investment in the UK has been sufficient. </p>

        <h3> Background / Graphs </h3>

 <!-- Chart 1: -->

        <div class="chart1" id="ProjectChart1"></div>

        <p>The chart above illustrates how enrolment at the primary, secondary, and tertiary level in the UK rival that of any
         other nation. However, spending on education in the UK falls short of nations including Sweden, the
        United States, and Canada. The <a href="https://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank"> World Bank API </a> only 
        provided data for individual countries and series at a time, so a series of loops were used in 
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YwCqySnaC_QRTJCi7e5kC5rkLs1Ecmpo?usp=sharing"
        target="_blank">Collaboratory</a> to collect and clean data. While data from 2017 was the most complete,
        missing values still plagued the data set. Another issue was that net tertiary enrolment data was unavailable, so gross values
        were used instead. Several names from the data also had to be manually changed to match the topojosn names (U.S to U.S.A) </p>

 <!-- Chart 2 -->
       
        <div class="chart2" id="ProjectChart2"></div>
       
        <p> Expenditure on education has fallen from 13% of total expenditure in the early 2000s to 11.78% in 2021, representing a historic low.
        However, real levels of spending (aggregate) have increased in recent years. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"
        target="_blank">Data </a> was obtained from each yearâ€™s annual budget report from HM Treasury. Aggregate expenditure had to be rebased using a 
        historical CPI for the UK as it was expressed nominally, and was done in <a href="https://github.com/GusHarper/GusHarper.github.io/blob/main/Government%20Spending%20Data%20Cleaning.do"
        target="_blank"> Stata.</a> The HM Treasury did not have an API for this data unfortunately, so collection had to be done manually. </p>

 <!-- Chart 3 -->

        <div class="chart3" id="ProjectChart3"></div>

        <p> Expenditure per pupil by LA Maintained Schools fell drastically from 2012-2017 after peaking in 2010, while recent figures from 2019 
        have indicated expenditure may be picking back up again. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-local-authority-school-finance-data"
        target="_blank">Data </a> was taken from yearly expenditure reports from HM Treasury, and was rebased using both a general inflation CPI, and an
        education-specific inflation CPI, taken from the ONS. Extracting data from the API, along with rebasing, was done in
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16t2ALYqPB-qIGOZgEy8xsE9fCkgjYLuP?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Collaboratory</a>. Initially I was unable to extract
        specific data from the API in it's json format, however was able to later overcome this by converting to a python dictionary. </p>

 <!-- Chart 4 -->

        <div class="chart4" id="ProjectChart4"></div>

        <p>To justify the importance of examining historical spending, the analysis is extended to show correlations 
        between spending and educational attainment and economic growth. The following regression indicates a positive correlation 
        between economic growth and spending on education, with a marginal effect of around 0.12. Data was taken from
        <a href="https://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank">The World Bank</a>. One issue with the regression was reverse
        causality, as economic growth could cause increases in expenditure, and vice versa. To address this, a 10-year lag was 
        implemented manually. Additionally, the years 2008-2011 we excluded to avoid bias from the financial crisis. </p>

 <!-- Chart 5 and 6 -->

        <div class="chart5" id="ProjectChart5"></div>
        <div class="chart6" id="ProjectChart6"></div>
   
        <p>To illustrate the effects of increased spending on educational attainment, a natural experiment was used.
        In 1993, Massachusetts announced an Education Reform Act that promised increased spending on primary
        and secondary education, while neighboring states Maine and CT did not. The first graph uses Difference-In-Difference techniques to 
        show the impact of the bill on revenues per pupil, as shown by the dashed yellow line ($858 lower). The second graph illustrates
        how following a 7-year lag (educational attainment measured at 25, 7 years after graduation), Massachusetts
        experienced a significant increase in educational attainment from this increased revenues per pupil. Data availability was an issue
        for these graphs, as the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2007/npefs13years/tables_b.asp" target="_blank"> NCES </a> and 
        <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/education/educational-attainment/data/tables.html" target="_blank"> U.S. Census Bureau </a> provide 
        figures dating back to only 1990. Additionally, measurement techniques changed after 2006, making analysis beyond this period difficult.
        The difference in difference analysis was done in <a href="https://github.com/GusHarper/GusHarper.github.io/blob/main/DifinDif.do" target="_blank"> Stata. </a></p>


 <!-- Chart 7 -->

        <div class="chart7" id="ProjectChart7"></div>

        <p>It is useful to examine productivity growth in the UK, as it has slowed drastically over the last several years while aggregate
        levels also lag behind that of Germany, the U.S, and France. Education is highly related to productivity levels, so this 
        <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/datasets/internationalcomparisonsofproductivityfirstestimates" 
        target ="_blank"> data</a> could indicate higher investment is needed. Data in the CSV file for this graph had to be converted to a tidy format (stacked),
        as initially only a single country was shown.
        </p>

 <!-- Conclusions -->

        <h3> Conclusions </h3>
        <p> Spending on Education in the UK has fallen drastically over the last decade, and has only recently started to 
        recover. As countries with higher expenditure on education typically also experience higher growth rates and 
        average educational attainment, it is undoubtedly of great interest for the UK to increase spending. However, it is difficult
        to draw conclusions and make recommendations given budget constraints, rising inflation, and increasing healthcare costs from the global
        pandemic and rising share of the population aged over 65. Nevertheless, the UK should look to marginally increase its spending in 
        the coming years to maintain the upward trajectory seen recently in several key measures, promoting sustained and
        inclusive economic growth. Word Count: 790
