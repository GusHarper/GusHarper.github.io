        <h1>Is the U.K Spending Enough on Education? TEST FOR PHONE 8 </h1>


<!-- Aims -->
        <h3>Aims</h3>

        <p>Education is a powerful agent of change, providing individuals with the skill-set and adaptability to 
        improve their standard of living, while also contributing to social stability and long term economic growth. 
        This project aims to provide a background on educational spending in the UK, compare its investment with that
        of other nations, and assess whether investment in the UK has been sufficient. (edit this later). </p>

        <h3> Background / Graphs </h3>

 <!-- Chart 1 -->

        <div class="chart1" id="ProjectChart1"></div>

        <p>The chart above illustrates how enrolment at the primary, secondary, and tertiary level in the UK rival that of any
         other nation. However, spending on education in the UK falls short of several other nations, including Sweden, the
        United States, and Canada. Data was obtained from <a href="https://data.worldbank.org"
        target="_blank">The World Bank</a> API. One issue with this API was that it only provided data for one country and
        series at a time, so a series of loops were used in
        <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1YwCqySnaC_QRTJCi7e5kC5rkLs1Ecmpo?usp=sharing"
        target="_blank">Collaboratory</a> to make collection easier. Data from 2017 had to be used, as more recent figures were incomplete 
        or missing for several nations. One issue with enrollment figures are that primary and secondary are net, while tertiary is gross. </p>

 <!-- Chart 2 -->
       
        <div class="chart2" id="ProjectChart2"></div>
       
        <p>Next, the analysis was extended to historical expenditure in the UK. Expenditure on education has fallen from 13% of total 
        expenditure in the early 2000s to 11.78% in 2021, representing a historic low. However, real levels of spending (aggregate)
        have increased in recent years. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury"
        target="_blank">Data </a> was obtained from each yearâ€™s annual budget from the HM Treasury. One issue with the 
        data was that aggregate expenditure needed to be rebased as it was expressed in nominal
        values. Using a historical CPI for the UK, these figures were rebased in 
        <a href="https://github.com/GusHarper/GusHarper.github.io/blob/main/Government%20Spending%20Data%20Cleaning.do"
        target="_blank"> Stata.</a></p>

 <!-- Chart 3 -->

        <div class="chart3" id="ProjectChart3"></div>

        <p> Expenditure per pupil by LA Maintained Schools fell drastically from 2012-2017 after peaking in 2010, while recent figures from 2019 
        have been far more promising <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-local-authority-school-finance-data"
        target="_blank">Data was taken from yearly expenditure reports from the HM Treasury, and to be be rebased in <a href=
        "https://github.com/GusHarper/GusHarper.github.io/blob/main/PerPupilExpenditure.do" target="_blank"> Stata.</a> Another 
        Issue with this data is the use of a general CPI for rebasing. While effective, a school-specific cost inflation CPI would likely imply 
        a smaller increase in spending from 2020-2021, due to increased teacher salaries, energy, and food costs. Spending per pupil from 2020-2021
        would likely be closer to levels seen in 2010, implying minimal (if any) increases over the last decade. </p>

 <!-- Chart 4 -->

        <div class="chart4" id="ProjectChart4"></div>

        <p>To justify the importance of examining historical spending, the analysis will be extended to show the correlations 
        between spending and educational attainment and economic growth. As can been in the following chart, the regression
        indicates a positive correlation between economic growth and spending on education. Data was taken from
        <a href="https://data.worldbank.org" target="_blank">The World Bank</a>. One issue with the regression was reverse
        causality, as economic growth could cause increases in expenditure, and vice versa. To address this, a 10-year lag was 
        implemented. Additionally, the years 2008-2011 we excluded to avoid bias from the financial crisis. 
        (If you have time, do the data cleaning in Collaboratory to make it look swag?) (92)</p>

 <!-- Chart 5 and 6 -->

        <div class="chart5" id="ProjectChart5"></div>
        <div class="chart6" id="ProjectChart6"></div>
   
        <p>To illustrate the effects of increased spending on educational attainment, a natural experiment was used.
        In 1993, the state of Massachusetts announced an Education Reform Act that promised increased spending on primary
        and secondary education, while Maine and CT did not. The first graph uses Difference-In-Difference techniques to 
        illustrate the impact of the bill on revenues per pupil, as shown by the dashed yellow line. The second graph illustrates
        how following a 7-year lag (educational attainment measurement measured at age 25, 7 years after graduation), Massachusetts
        experienced a significant increase in educational attainment from this increased revenue per pupil. Data availability was an issue
        for these graphs, as the NCES and U.S Census Bureau only dated back to 1990. Additionally, measurement techniques changed after 
        2006 making analysis beyond this period difficult. The difference in difference analysis was done in
        <a href="https://github.com/GusHarper/GusHarper.github.io/blob/main/DifinDif.do" target="_blank"> Stata. </a></p>


 <!-- Chart 7 -->

        <div class="chart7" id="ProjectChart7"></div>

        <p>It is useful to exame productivity growth in the UK, as it has slowed drastically over the last several years while aggregate
        levels also lag behind that of Germany, the U.S, and France. Education is highly related to productivty levels, so this data could indicate 
        higher investment is needed (EDIT this last sentence).
        </p>

 <!-- Conclusions -->

        <h3> Conclusions </h3>
        <p> Spending on Education in the UK has fallen over the last decade, with spending as a % of total government expenditure 
        hitting historic lows in 2021. Additionally, spending per pupil fell drastically from 2012-2017, and has only recently 
        started to recover. The UK does well for enrollment in education compared to other nations, however lags slightly behind in spending.
        As countries with higher expenditure on education have typically also experieced higher growth rates, and expenditure has been shown 
        to drive increases in average educational attainment, it is undoubtably of great interest for the UK to increase spending. This may
        also help address plateuing productivty growth seen in recent years. While it is difficult to draw conclusions given budget constraints,
        rising inflation, and increasing healthscare costs from the global pandemic and rising share of the population aged over 65, the UK should 
        look to marginally increase its spending in the coming years to maintain the upwards trajectory in spending per pupil seen in recent years, 
        and promote sustained economic growth (edit last sentence too.)
